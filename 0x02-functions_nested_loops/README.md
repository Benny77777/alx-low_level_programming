Description
The ALX Functions Task repository contains a collection of functions implemented in the C programming language. Each function is designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. The code is organized into separate files, with each file containing the implementation of one or more functions.

Getting Started
To get started with the ALX Functions Task, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-functions-task.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Copy
cd alx-functions-task
Compile the source code using a C compiler:

Copy
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o alx_functions
Run the compiled executable:

Copy
./alx_functions
Usage
The ALX Functions Task project provides a set of functions that can be used in other C programs or projects. To use a specific function, include the corresponding header file in your source code and call the function as needed.

For example, to use the calculate_sum function, include the sum.h header file and call the function in your code:

c
Copy
#include "sum.h"

int main(void) {
    int result = calculate_sum(3, 5);
    printf("The sum is: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
